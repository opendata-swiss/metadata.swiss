## Limitation of liability

Although every care has been taken by the authorities involved in the opendata.swiss portal to review the information published, no warranty can be given in respect of the correctness, accuracy, up-to-dateness, reliability or completeness of this information.

The authorities involved in the opendata.swiss portal expressly reserve the right to amend, delete or suspend publication of content, either in whole or in part, at any time without prior notice.

In no event will the authorities be liable for any loss or damage of a material or immaterial nature arising from access to, use or non-use of the published information, or from misuse of the connection or technical faults.

## References and links

References and links to third party websites lie outside the scope of responsibility of the authorities involved in the opendata.swiss portal. Access and use of such websites occurs entirely at the user’s own risk. The authorities involved in the opendata.swiss portal expressly state that they have no influence whatsoever over the design, content or offering of any linked site. Responsibility for information and services of linked sites rests entirely with the relevant third party. No liability can be accepted in respect of the content of such websites.

## Data protection

Based on Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution and the provisions of Swiss data protection legislation, everyone has the right to the protection of privacy, as well as to protection from misuse of their personal details. The authorities involved in the opendata.swiss portal comply with these provisions. Personal data is treated as strictly confidential on the opendata.swiss portal and is neither passed on nor sold to third parties.

In close cooperation with our hosting providers, we make every effort to protect the databases from outside access, data loss, misuse or falsification.

When you access opendata.swiss, the following data is stored in log files: IP address, date, time, browser request and general information on the operating system and browser. Our hosting providers’ web servers merely register impersonal site usage data (log files) for the purpose of tracking trends for the authorities involved in the opendata.swiss portal in order to improve the information offering. For further information on web analysis, see the next section.

Usage data are not linked to personal data. There is an exception, namely when you choose to make contact with us. If you register your e-mail address, this is then stored in a separate database not connected in any way with the anonymous log files. You may delete your registration at any time.

## Web analysis

opendata.swiss uses the open-source web analysis service Piwik. Piwik uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer to help the website to analyse the use made of the site by its users. To this end, the usage information generated by the cookie (including your abbreviated IP address) is transferred to our server in Switzerland and stored for usage analysis purposes. This data is used to optimise the website. In this process, your IP address is anonymised without delay.

You can prevent cookies being stored by changing your browser settings accordingly; however, this may mean that not all the functions of the website can be used.

## Copyright

The information published on opendata.swiss is not normally subject to copyright. The same applies to official decrees and non-internal administrative decisions, minutes and reports. Where such documents are concerned, the interest in unimpeded dissemination outweighs the originator’s interests in respect of protection. The information contained in opendata.swiss is made available to the public.
