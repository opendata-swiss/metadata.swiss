## What is a showcase?

A showcase is a concrete example of how public data are turned into value:
applications, dashboards, visualizations, analyses, reports, or interactive
stories. It highlights ideas, methods and results so that others can learn and
get inspired.

## Why do showcases matter?

- They illustrate practical reuse of datasets published on opendata.swiss.
- They help data providers and users discover connections between datasets.
- They encourage good practices and spark new projects in the community.

## What can be submitted?

- Applications, websites or visualizations that make data accessible
- Analyses, reports or blog posts using open data
- Educational and civic-tech projects

## Submit your own showcase
