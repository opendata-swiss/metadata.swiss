## Do you want to send us data?

The aim of this portal is to reference all OGD of the Confederation, cantons and communes in Switzerland. Third parties – parastate enterprises, persons carrying out tasks for the Confederation, cantons or communes – are also invited to publish their data provided that they are of public interest and even if they are already referenced on other websites.

Do you wish to provide open access to data from your organisation on opendata.swiss?
