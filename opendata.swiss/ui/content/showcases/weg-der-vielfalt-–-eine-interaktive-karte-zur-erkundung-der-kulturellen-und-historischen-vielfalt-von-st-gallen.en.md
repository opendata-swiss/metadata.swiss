The **“Path of Diversity”** (“Weg der Vielfalt”) is an interactive map that highlights 86 significant locations in St. Gallen, bearing witness to justice and commitment, but also to discrimination and colonialism. This participatory project, led by the city after two years of collective work, invites an inclusive reading of urban history through modern geospatial technologies.

### Concrete use cases

***Education and culture:***

* **Educational visits**

  : Ideal for schools, universities, and cultural institutions wishing to address issues of diversity, historical memory, and human rights.
* **Cultural tourism**

  : Offer visitors an alternative urban itinerary through little-known but historically and socially significant places.

***Urban and sociological research:***

* **Analysis of urban memory**

  : Study the representation of diversity in public spaces and how it has evolved.
* **Participatory studies**

  : Useful database for research in social sciences, critical urban planning, or postcolonialism.

### Technologies and data

The app is based on an interactive map accessible via a mobile browser or computer. By activating geolocation, users can explore places **in situ** or remotely.

The **data (excluding images)** is available as **Open Data** on the City of St. Gallen platform, allowing for free reuse (e.g., guided tours, educational or artistic projects).

### Topics covered

The 86 locations are divided into eight categories:

* Migration and asylum
* Racism and anti-Semitism
* Colonialism
* Women's history
* Queer history
* Memory of engagement
* Discrimination and social justice
* Solidarity and coexistence

Each location is presented with a text written in inclusive, respectful, and critical language, validated by external experts.

### Access and terms of use

The app is **free**, **open access**, and **continuously updated**. Discover the locations and their history via this link: [https://wegdervielfalt.ch](https://wegdervielfalt.ch/)
