# Showcase collection

## Editorial workflow

In addition to the decap workflow, showcases can also be created using a public submission form (see below). Both methods create Pull Requests in the repository, which can then be reviewed and published using the decap Content Manager.

## Fields

### Image

The image is displayed in the "lead" section of the showcase page.

### Active

When unchecked, the showcase will not be displayed on the public website and is excluded from harvesting by piveau.

### Type of content, Category

Select boxes populated from Piveau vocabularies.

### Tags

Comma-separated list to be used for filtering in Piveau.

## Submitting showcases

The submission form is accessible on the [public website](https://piveau.test.ods.zazukoians.org/de/showcases/submit).

To submit a form, it is required to select the type and image on the "General" tab. It is also necessary to provide at least a title and description in one or more languages. Missing languages would be filled in by editors later, using decap Content Manager.
